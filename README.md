## General info
The project firstly was designed in Adobe XD for both mobile and desktop environments.  
When coding I started with whole HTML structure and later moved to building a mobile version according to the mobile first design rule.  
For styling purposes I've used SASS preprocessor with .scss extension so I could use the BEM methodology a lot easier.  
Graphics on the site were created as .svg in Adobe XD so scaling them won't break quality of the image.
